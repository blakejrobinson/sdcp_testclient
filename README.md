# SDCP example client

A very small (very crude) Electron test client for my [SDCP NodeJS module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sdcp).

It is not pretty (does not sandbox) but it's purely to test features and demonstrate how the codebase works.

#### Features

- Discovery, address book and printer status monitoring,
- File uploading,
- Camera capture (V3.0.0),
- File browsing (V3.0.0),
- Start printing from browser (V3.0.0)
